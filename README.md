# NandToTetrisProj02
This is a project from my second year module "Computer Systems", there are 12 projects in this module where we start from a nand gate and end up building a tetris game. 
In this part of the project, we started with our 16 gates and had to build a Half-Adder, 8-Bit Add, Incrementer, Full-Adder, ALU.
